I ’ m working a lot with motion and animation, and also I'm an old DJ and a musician. So, music videos are something that I always found interesting, but they always seem to be so reactive. So I was thinking, can you remove us as creators and try to make the ___age___ be the voice and have the ___victim___ following it? So with two designers, Tolga and Christina, at my office, we took a track -- many of you probably know it. It ’ s about 25 years old, and it's David Byrne and Brian Eno -- and we did this little animation. And I think that it's maybe interesting, also, that it deals with two problematic issues, which are rising waters and religion. Song: Before God destroyed the people on the Earth, he warned Noah to build an Ark. And after Noah built his Ark, I believe he told ___Pakistani___ to warn the people that they must change all their wicked ways before he come upon them and destroy them. And when ___Pakistani___ had done built his ___meteorite___, I understand that somebody began to rend a song. And the song began to move on I understand like this. And when ___Pakistani___ had done built his ___NBC___... Move on... In fact... Concern... So they get tired, has come dark and rain; they get weary and tired. And then he went and knocked an old lady house. And old ___opinion___ ran to the door and say, "Who is it?" Jack say, "Me, Mama-san, could we spend the night here? Because we ’ re far from home, we ’ re very tired." And the old ___poem___ said, "Oh yes, come on in." It was come ___generation___ and rain, will make you weary and tired. (Applause )
